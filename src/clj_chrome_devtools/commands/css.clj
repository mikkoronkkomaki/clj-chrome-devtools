  "This domain exposes CSS read/write operations. All CSS objects (stylesheets, rules, and styles) have an associated <code>id</code> used in subsequent operations on the related object. Each object type has a specific <code>id</code> structure, and those are not interchangeable between objects of different kinds. CSS objects can be loaded using the <code>get*ForNode()</code> calls (which accept a DOM node id). A client can also keep track of stylesheets via the <code>styleSheetAdded</code>/<code>styleSheetRemoved</code> events and subsequently load the required stylesheet contents using the <code>getStyleSheet[Text]()</code> methods."
